THIS MODPACK INCLUDES TWO DIFFERENT EXPANSION PACKS THAT YOU CAN ADD ONTO IT WITHIN THE MODS FOLDER IF YOU WANT A MORE TECH OR RPG FOCUSED VERSION, AS WELL AS AN EXTRA'S FOLDER.

ANY MOD IN THE EXTRAS FOLDER WASN'T ORIGINALLY INTENDED FOR THIS MODPACK'S USE, BUT CAN BE USED ANYWAY IF NEEDED. ALL EXTRA CLIENTSIDED MODS WERE TESTED AND WORK PERFECTLY FINE. SERVERSIDED MODS WERE NOT TESTED. BE WARNED.

THERE IS ALSO A NOTES.TXT EXPLAINING WHAT EACH CLIENT-SIDED MOD DOES!!

WHEN ADDING EXPANSION PACKS PLEASE READ THE README'S WITHIN THEM AND FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS!!!

THERE IS LITTLE TO NO MANUAL DOCUMENTATION ON THE MODS IN THIS PACK, IF YOU FIND SOMETHING COOL AND CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT IT DOES OR HOW TO USE IT, PLEASE LOOK UP THE MOD'S WIKI. SOURCES WILL NOT BE PROVIDED!

HAVE FUN, RELAX, AND ENJOY THIS HANDCRAFTED PIECE OF WORK I'VE MADE!
