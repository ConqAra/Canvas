  * Hello there! thanks for using my mod!
  * You guessed it, this file is the config file for my RecipeDisabler mod.
  * Just a quick warning before getting any further with this mod.
  * While the command helps out with editing the config, it does not apply the
  * changes immediately! In fact, this mod only applies changes upon resources
  * loading. So you have to enable "save on reload" or manually save if you have
  * "auto reload" enabled, and then reload the resources (just the /reload command)
  * And with that being said, enjoy!
  * ~Nerjal
