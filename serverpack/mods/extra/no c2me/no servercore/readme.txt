if you don't want servercore, replace servercore with dynview.

farsight is if you want more render distance on a server than what it would give you. goes well with dynview but is outclassed by bobby imo.

if you want to still use bobby instead of farsight, you can use hold that chunk to force the server to request for more cache data when flying/moving at high speeds.
