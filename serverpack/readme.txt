install 1.18.2 fabric server: https://fabricmc.net/use/server/
assuming you know how to set up a server (either through a host provider or port forwarding), just drag these 3 folders into the server folder after accepting eula.

you can also use the 'pfmUpdateInfo.json' and rewrite it as a server welcome message!

recommended to use the server.properties in here! difficulty is on hard and whitelist is automatically enforced, change those if need be.

YOU NEED JDK18 OR YOU CANNOT RUN THE SERVER!!!
RUN.BAT'S "_"PATH MAY HAVE TO BE CHANGED IN ORDER TO BE USED, DEPENDING ON WHERE JDK18 IS LOCATED ON YOUR PC!!!
