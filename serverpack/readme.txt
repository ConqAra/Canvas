install 1.18.2 fabric server: https://fabricmc.net/use/server/
assuming you know how to set up a server (either through a host provider or port forwarding), just drag these 3 folders into the server folder after accepting eula.

you can also use the 'pfmUpdateInfo.json' and rewrite it as a server welcome message!
