# Canvas

canvas modpack i made for my friends. a huge collection of fabric mods (sort of) balanced and made with the intention of a modded experience that doesn't take away from the main premise of minecraft like other huge modpacks, but instead adds onto it to create a fun experience that can be used decently on low-end pcs. has a bunch of tweaks, rpg and tech aspects, overhauls, and all-around quality of life. has a lot of love and effort put into it, worked on this for over 2 years and am happy with the results. enjoy!

> ## ![CanvasDev](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d313aa56-7fbd-43d7-bf99-a45618315992) some notable info:
  
> - [automatic qol tree punching](https://github.com/hammertater/treechop). if you want to ignore the feature or have a timber-like enchantment make sure to hold shift while breaking.
> - [when falling into the void in the end, you will not die](https://github.com/The-Fireplace-Minecraft-Mods/Unforgiving-Void). instead you will fall into the sky of the overworld. you can still die from fall damage, but at least you won't lose everything permanently!
> - you can manually crawl whenever now. just [shift + v] to toggle it. can be pretty handy or funny i guess.
> - through [numismatic overhaul](https://github.com/wisp-forest/numismatic-overhaul) our economy has changed! emeralds are no longer used in 99% of trading. we now have a currency similar to terraria with bronze, silver, and gold coins. 1 silver coin is about equal to 1 emerald. these coins can be found by looting chests, killing pillagers, and breaking pots underground. you have a purse in your inventory that holds these coins for you, being able to withdraw them from the purse at any time. the purse does not have a storage limit! dying will drop a percentage of these coins on the ground where you died, ignoring your gravestone.
> - [you have health levels now](https://github.com/SmushyTaco/Health-Levels/)! it's the red bar besides your xp bar. when you get a certain amount of xp, you'll gain an extra heart! the level cap is 10, up to 10 extra hearts. the algorithm is exponentially 7 levels worth of xp (i.e. getting 7 to 14). calculations can be found in the config. to put it simply you need to reach level 70 to gain all 10 extra hearts. **be warned, if you die you lose your health levels**.
> - [the armor system is reworked](https://github.com/Jackiecrazy/ArmorCurve), with effectiveness being adjusted so that the more armor you have, the less every extra armor point adds to your total protection. armor damage reduces the protective capabilities of your armor, reducing your defense based on its durability at a 40% cap.
> - a few benefits have been added to certain armor sets, making them more well-rounded and interesting to use:
>   - leather armor increases your movement speed with each piece, a full set is similar to a potion of switftness. the tunic and cap also slightly increase your attack speed.
>   - gold armor increases your max health by 1.5 hp per piece, so 6 hp (3 hearts) with a full set.
>   - chainmail armor increases your damage by 0.75 per piece, up to 3 extra attack damage. it's a good offensive set.
>   - iron, diamond, and netherite armor are unchanged.
>   - a full set of gilded netherite has slightly more defensive attributes than netherite and makes you immune to lava/fire and piglin aggro completely. as well as 6 knockback resistance with a full set!
>   - ametrine armor (found in the end, upgrade through either gilded or plain netherite) has the same amount of defense as gilded netherite, but also increases your max health by 3 hp per piece, equating to 12 hp (6 hearts) with a full set. however it does not have any knockback resistance or other specialities (lava/fire immunity, etc.) like gilded netherite, so choose wisely!
> - all gold weapons now attack faster, giving an additional 0.4 extra attack speed. i always found it weird how gold tools had this extra speed boost that made them unique, but gold weapons didn't.
> - the recipe for a shield is slightly more expensive.
> - you can easily embrace your [create](https://github.com/Fabricators-of-Create/Create) autism in this pack!

> multiplayer features:
> - [pinging](https://github.com/LukenSkyne/Minecraft-Ping-Wheel)! there is a ping system in this mod, make sure to configure the appropriate channel for your teammates in your settings with [f6]. I have it set to 1 automatically.
> - [proximity chat](https://github.com/plasmoapp/plasmo-voice), tweak settings with [y]. it's automatically on push to talk with [alt] to talk and [m] to mute.
> - [heartbound](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/heartbond) introduces a teleport system. when crafting soul links from the mod, use a crafting table (actually, use a crafting table for *anything* from that mod please. **do not** craft it in terminals, otherwise the heartbound function for the soul links won't work!!!)
> - you can now set up trading tables that have an inventory stock and villager-like trade function with the new currency. automatic trades between players can be made through this block.

<summary>some more cool info:</summary>

>   - villagers no longer sell treasure enchantments. this encourages explorting! [villagers are also economically changed](https://gitlab.com/supersaiyansubtlety/economical_villager_trading/). restocking is a bit more interesting with providing the need to buy all sell trades to refill all buy trades, and vice versa. this encourages more trading variety and getting that currency usage up!
>   - [the wandering trader now sells treasure enchantments](https://github.com/Ineffa/Truly-Treasures) for a hefty price.
>   - [there are now more types of illagers](https://github.com/Fuzss/illagerinvasion), with various structures to explore and loot. some of these new illagers (illusioner, sorceror, and the invoker) drop special materials to obtain the tool leveling table and reforging station.
>   - once you aquire a netherite ingot, you can make an [infusion table](https://github.com/jptrzy/infusion-table-mod). this will allow you to put enchanted items with a book and convert those enchantments onto the book (i.e. gold boots with mending are valuable now) so if you cannot find that mending book in chests, at least you have another option!
>   - [dark enchanting](https://github.com/frqnny/dark-enchanting) is unlocked after defeating the wither. this is a more costly but way more efficient method of enchanting. you can pick any enchantment you want (besides demon enchantments) for anything you provide into the dark enchanter, however it will cost a lot to enchant. [there is a discount mechanic where you can reduce this cost by making a structure for it](https://github.com/frqnny/dark-enchanting/wiki/Dark-Shrine---How-to-get-Discounts-with-the-Dark-Enchanter). you can also de-enchant things and gain xp, thus exploring chests and mob grinding is even more encouraged!
>   - [demon enchanting](https://github.com/IlMusu/IlMusuEnchantmentsMod) is a special type of enchanting, demon-altering enchantment tables by putting 3 wither skulls around it. more skulls will amplify the chance of encountering demon enchantments. this will allow the table to offer you demon enchantments, which have certain drawbacks. however demon-enchanting requires sacrafices based on the level/power of the demon enchantment.
>   - [collectible cards](https://github.com/T-T-Team/CollectorsAlbum) are now in the game, with different tiers of rarities! these card packs are only dropped by mobs. a mob has a 5% chance of dropping one, with even lesser odds of it being higher rarities. craft a collector's album and hold control over it to see the benefits of collecting. these are very very powerful permanent buffs in the long run. i highly recommend investing into it! note that these buffs and benefits will only apply to you if the album is within your inventory. backpacks don't count, so be careful not to lose it!!!
>   - there's two mods that introduce [artifacts](https://github.com/ochotonida/artifacts) you can find from chests [or craft](https://github.com/wisp-forest/things) and put on your character. to accomodate for the amount of trinkets, i've allowed more trinket slots. back 2; necklace 3; aglet 2; shoes 2; gloves 2 (per hand); face 2; hat 2; belt 3. later down the line, for a hefty price, is an item that can combine two trinkets together! be wary that the process is undoable, and the two trinkets must be of the same type of equipment slot (i.e. aglet + aglet) or else you cannot equip it.
>   - you can get [cool looking cosmetic hats](https://github.com/fonnymunkey/SimpleHats) that use the hat trinket slot! they only are found in chest loot tables, making them pretty rare even with the variety. you can also wear 2 at the same time! also all useful trinket items that originally used the hat slot now conveniently use the face slot.
>   - there is a lunar event called the crimson moon that is basically a terraria blood moon. it has a small chance of happening when it turns night. mobs spawned from the crimson moon have a small chance of dropping scarlet gems which you can use to craft powerful weaponry relatively early. the odds of encountering a crimson moon are by default 1 every 30 minecraft days. you can also summon it by using a scarlet tear at night.
>   - instead of ae2, we use [slotlink](https://github.com/badasintended/slotlink). it's a less tech-focused version, not requiring as much knowledge or effort to use. acts as a simple storage network with some qol. the remotes also have a trinket slot for quick easy access by pressing [i].
>   - [tool leveling](https://github.com/tristankechlo/ToolLeveling) is a late game enchantment enhancer. you can break the cap of certain enchantments on your gear, allowing for things like sharpness 6, etc. by giving it valuable materials/ores. once a certain amount is met, you can increase the cap of the enchantment selected on the item. you can view the "item values" config to see how much each material gives.
>   - with the tiered system, you can make a reforging station! it allows you to put various different types of modifiers on your tools, weapons, and armor! use xp to modify your gear. the modifiers are based on a rarity system, as well as the amount of xp needed to roll it. some modifiers give harsh drawbacks or even just worse stats, so be careful about carelessly reforging your gear!
>   - [there are new bosses to fight](https://github.com/barribob/bosses-of-mass-destruction)! they're difficult. it's highly recommended to be pretty geared up when attempting to fight them. the lich is the easiest, followed by the void blossom. those are the only overworld ones, you'll encounter more in the other dimensions. the order how you fight them is up to you though.
>   - the wither and ender dragon are buffed, both gaining a 100 more hp.
>   - the ender dragon's arena is overhauled and now scales off players.
>   - this pack includes [end remastered](https://github.com/Jack-Bagel/End-Remastered), which makes getting to late game a little more challenging. find 13 different eyes of ender by exploring!
