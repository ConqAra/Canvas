# Canvas

canvas modpack i made for my friends. a huge collection of fabric mods (sort of) balanced and made with the intention of a modded experience that doesn't take away from the main premise of minecraft like other huge modpacks, but instead adds onto it to create a fun experience that can be used decently on low-end pcs. has a bunch of tweaks, rpg and tech aspects, overhauls, and all-around quality of life. has a lot of love and effort put into it, worked on this for over a year and am happy with the results. enjoy!

disclaimer: none of these mods were made by me.

minecraft version: 1.18.2

java version: jdk 18

recommendations:
8gb ram MINIMUM for singleplayer.
10gb ram MINIMUM for hosting a server.
note: if you are joining a multiplayer server and not hosting one with canvas, you only need like 6gb. the server will do all the hardwork for you.
