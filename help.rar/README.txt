IF YOU ARE GETTING ERRORS PLEASE REFER TO THE 'JAVACOMPATIBILITYCHECK.PNG' OR 'LINUX USERS.TXT'!!!

THIS MODPACK INCLUDES TWO DIFFERENT EXPANSION PACKS THAT YOU CAN ADD ONTO CANVAS IF YOU WANT A MORE TECH OR RPG FOCUSED VERSION, AS WELL AS AN OPTIONAL AND EXTRAS FOLDER.

ANY MOD IN THE EXTRAS FOLDER WASN'T ORIGINALLY INTENDED FOR THIS MODPACK'S USE, BUT CAN BE USED ANYWAY IF NEEDED. ALL EXTRA CLIENTSIDED MODS WERE TESTED AND WORK PERFECTLY FINE.

THERE IS ALSO A NOTES.TXT IN THE EXTRA FOLDER EXPLAINING WHAT EACH CLIENT-SIDED MOD DOES!!

WHEN ADDING EXPANSION PACKS PLEASE READ THE README'S WITHIN THEM AND FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS!!!

THERE IS LITTLE TO NO MANUAL DOCUMENTATION ON THE MODS IN THIS PACK, IF YOU FIND SOMETHING COOL AND CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT IT DOES OR HOW TO USE IT, PLEASE LOOK UP THE MOD'S WIKI. SOURCES WILL NOT BE PROVIDED!

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND USING PRISM/MULTIMC OR A SIMILAR MODLAUNCHER.

HAVE FUN!
