these are mods that are completely optional to add. unlike the ones in the extra folder, these are completely intended and encouraged to be used if the player wishes to!


add winterly if it's the holidays and you're feeling festive!

add tectonic if you want an "improved" overhaul of worldgen; making mountains bigger, oceans deeper, and the surface smoother. it's all preference!
please note: while it's compatible with terralith and *most* of the terrain/structure mods, it's still a **bit experimental**.
