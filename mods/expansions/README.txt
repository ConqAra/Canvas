extra content packs you can alter between, would not recommend adding more than one expansion to the pack, PLEASE READ THE READEME'S IN THEIR RESPECTIVE EXPANSION FOLDERS!!!

the rpg expansion completely revamps the look of combat, adds an integrated, more in-depth level-up system as well as rpg-themed mods that help the balance of the expansion.

IF YOU'RE HOSTING A SERVER, THE DATAPACKS IN THE RPG/TECH EXPANSION NEED TO GO TO INTO THE PAXI CONFIG FOLDER UNDER DATAPACKS!!!

the tech expansion adds a lot more tech-related mods to the modpack, from your classic tech machines and lua computers to literal giant mechs and galatic craft.

the "if its december add this for festivities" just makes things more christmassy, you can put it in the mods folder whenever no matter what expansion you're using.
